    <!-- Notes:
- Installed the right Node.js version using NVM (Node Version Manager).
  nvm install 24
  nvm use 24
- Used a .nvmrc file to lock the project Node version.
- Used "npx sv create", selected ESLint and Prettier, and chose ES Modules.
- The setup does not work with Node versions older than v24.
- Followed the official Svelte tutorial and added a Table of Contents (TOC).

    <h2>Understands how code and its placement affects application memory and efficiency.</h2>
    <p>Code structure and placement can greatly impact how efficiently an application uses memory and CPU resources.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Functions and variables should be declared only when needed to reduce memory usage.</li>
        <li>Use local scope to limit memory allocation and prevent global memory leaks.</li>
        <li>Avoid unnecessary imports or large libraries that increase bundle size.</li>
        <li>Use lazy loading or dynamic imports to load code only when it’s needed.</li>
        <li>Optimize loops and data structures to reduce unnecessary processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Efficient code placement leads to faster load times and lower memory consumption, especially in large or
        long-running applications.</p>

    <h2>Understands the arguments for and against SSR vs. CSR when it comes to:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Load time:</strong>
            SSR (Server-Side Rendering) sends pre-rendered HTML to the client, so content appears faster.
            CSR (Client-Side Rendering) loads a blank page first and renders content with JavaScript, so the first load
            is slower but navigation is faster after initial load.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Resources spent (duration, when and where):</strong>
            SSR uses server resources to render each page request.
            CSR uses the client’s (browser’s) resources, reducing server load but increasing client work.
        </li>
        <li><strong>SEO:</strong>
            SSR is better for SEO because search engines can immediately read the rendered HTML.
            CSR can have SEO issues unless pre-rendering or hydration is used.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dealing with CORS:</strong>
            SSR avoids CORS issues since all API requests can be made directly from the server.
            CSR must follow CORS rules when fetching from external APIs.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Can argue for better ways to structure the code and how to avoid files that are too long.</h2>
    <p>Well-structured code improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Split long files into smaller modules or components.</li>
        <li>Follow clear folder structures (<code>/routes</code>, <code>/controllers</code>, <code>/utils</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Group related logic together and separate concerns (business logic vs. UI logic).</li>
        <li>Use helper functions or utility modules for repetitive logic.</li>
        <li>Keep functions small and focused — each should do one thing well.</li>
        <li>Adopt consistent naming conventions and code formatting (use ESLint and Prettier).</li>
    </ul>
